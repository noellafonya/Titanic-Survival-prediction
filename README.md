# Titanic Survival Prediction Project

## 📖 Project Overview
This project predicts passenger survival on the Titanic using machine learning. The model achieves **80.4% accuracy** in predicting whether a passenger survived based on their characteristics.

## 🎯 Key Findings
- **Gender was the strongest predictor** (26.5% importance)
- **Fare price** was equally important (26.5%) - higher fare = better survival
- **Age** was the third most important factor (24.2%)
- Women, children, and higher-class passengers had significantly better survival rates

## 📊 Model Performance
- **Accuracy**: 80.4%
- **Precision**: 80%
- **Recall**: 80%
- **F1-Score**: 80%

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Pandas & NumPy (Data manipulation)
- Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Visualization)
- Google Colab (Development environment)
